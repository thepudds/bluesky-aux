Some re-usable auxiliary packages to make it slightly easier to work with Bluesky and the AT Protocol in Go

This is currently used by [thepudds/gomoderate](https://github.com/thepudds/gomoderate), a CLI for self-moderation of Bluesky, which includes bulk muting of unpleasant accounts blocked by accounts you trust.

Package appkey contains logic extracted from https://github.com/karalabe/go-bluesky and is copyright the go-bluesky authors.
